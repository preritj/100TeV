## Installing Madgraph :
* Download madgraph from the web : 

```
wget https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo/2.0/2.3.0/+download/MG5_aMC_v2.3.3.tar.gz 
tar -zxvf MG5_aMC_v2.3.3.tar.gz
```

* To include S<sub>T</sub>  cut, some madgraph files need to be modified. I have placed these modified files (with paths) in `MadGraph` folder, replace your original MadGraph files with the ones included here.
